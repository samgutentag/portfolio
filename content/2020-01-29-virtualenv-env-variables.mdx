Working environments is made even better by defining some variables that are only active in that
specific environment.

## Set Variables

navigate to `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate`

{% highlight bash %} export FIRST_NAME="Sam" export LAST_NAME="Gutentag" {% endhighlight %}

## Unset Variables

navigate to `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/predeactivate`

{% highlight bash %} unset FIRST_NAME unset LAST_NAME {% endhighlight %}

## Verify Variables are being Set and Unset correctly

In this example, use the command `$ printenv | grep _NAME`

- Before activating the virtualenv, it should return no results
- After activating the virtualenv, it should return our variables
- After deactivating the virtualenv, it should return no results
