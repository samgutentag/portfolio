## Using JetBrains Mono Inside VSCode

JetBrains Mono can be downloaded from the [JetBrains Site Here][jetbrains-font]

The information below assumes that you have downloaded the font, unzipped it and added to the macOS
Font Book.app

### macOS settings.json file location

On macOS the `settings.json` file is located here:

```bash
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
```

### Contents of Settings File

Here is a snippet from my `settings.json` file, commented for reference.

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'JetBrains Mono', Consolas, monospace", // Set the font
  "editor.fontLigatures": true // Turn on font ligatures
}
```
