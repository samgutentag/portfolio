## The "Just Fork It" Problem

In my [last post](/blog/2026-02-10-let-claude-cook-burgers), I built an interactive map for Santa Barbara Burger Week using Claude Code and casually wrote:

> You can fork the repo, edit `data.js` with your restaurants, push to GitHub, and you're live.

That was aspirational. In reality, someone forking the repo for their own food event would also need to manually update:

- The Open Graph image (SVG and PNG)
- The CNAME file for their custom domain
- HTML `<title>` tags across three pages
- Favicon emoji in three HTML files
- Venmo link text and URL
- The README title, hits badge, and embed snippet
- A hardcoded Cloudflare analytics token

That's **SEVEN FILES** of find-and-replace. Nobody's doing that. The "just fork it" promise was more of a "just fork it and then spend howver long hunting down every place I hardcoded something."

## One Config File to Rule Them All

```prompt title="Claude Code Prompt"
Create a config file so someone can rebrand this for a different food event by editing one file
```

Claude Code created `config.js` to have a single object with everything event-specific:

```js
const THEME = {
  eventName: "SB Burger Week 2026",
  eventDates: "Feb 19–25",
  emoji: "🍔",
  itemLabel: "burger",
  siteUrl: "https://sbburgerweekmap.com",
  venmoUser: "samgutentag",
  cfAnalyticsToken: "abc123...",
  // ... and more
};
```

The main app, embed, and print page all read from this at runtime. JavaScript handles the dynamic stuff: meta tags, page titles, header text, Venmo links. Change the config, refresh, and the app rebrands itself.

But some things _can't_ read JavaScript at runtime. The OG image is a static PNG that social media crawlers fetch. The CNAME is a plain text file. README badges are just markdown. These need to be rewritten on disk.

## The Apply Script

```prompt title="Claude Code Prompt"
Now build a script that reads config.js and updates everything else
```

Claude Code built `apply-theme.py`, a Python script that parses `config.js` with regex, then:

1. **Updates `og-image.svg`**: finds `<text>` elements by their y-coordinate and swaps the content
2. **Regenerates `og-image.png`**: renders the SVG with ImageMagick, then composites a Twemoji PNG on top (because ImageMagick can't render emoji from SVG, it just draws a blank box, which is a fun thing to discover at 11pm)
3. **Rewrites `CNAME`**: extracts the domain from the site URL
4. **Updates HTML fallbacks**: favicon emoji, `<title>` tags, header text, Venmo links across all three HTML files
5. **Patches `README.md`**: title, hits badge URL, embed snippet

All stdlib Python, no pip install. The only external dependency is ImageMagick for the PNG, and if it's not installed the script just skips that step and warns you.

The fork workflow is now actually what I promised:

```bash
# 1. Edit config.js with your event details
# 2. Run the theme script
python3 apply-theme.py
# 3. Push to GitHub Pages
```

## Generalizing Beyond Burgers

While building the config system i realized the data file had a `burger` field on every restaurant entry. That's a pretty burger-specific name for what's really just "the featured menu item."

```prompt title="Claude Code Prompt"
update the data.js, mock_data.js and references to the "burger" attribute to be "menuItem"
```

A straightforward rename across five files: `data.js`, `mock_data.js`, `app.js`, `embed.js`, and the README's fork guide. The CSS classes (`popup-burger`, `burger-icon`) stayed as-is since they're just style hooks that don't leak into the fork experience (and a throwback to the original project, why not). The config already had `itemLabel: "burger"` for display text, so the UI still says "burger" everywhere it should.

Taco week, ramen week, pizza week, if it's popsicle, it's possble!

## Cleaning Up the Analytics Token

The Cloudflare Web Analytics token was hardcoded in `index.html`. It's not a secret, it's client-side JavaScript visible to anyone who views source. But for forkers, it's one more thing to hunt down and remove or update.

Moved it to `config.js` as `cfAnalyticsToken`. The apply script now injects or removes the `<script>` snippet based on whether the token is set:

```js
// Set your own token, or null to remove analytics entirely
cfAnalyticsToken: "your-token-here",
```

Set it to `null`, run the script, and the snippet disappears from the HTML. No digging through markup to find and delete someone else's tracking code.

## The Actual Fork Test

To verify everything works end-to-end, I swapped the config to a hypothetical taco week:

```js
eventName: "SB Taco Week 2026",
emoji: "🌮",
siteUrl: "https://sbtacoweekmap.com",
itemLabel: "taco",
```

Ran the script. Every file updated correctly: CNAME said `sbtacoweekmap.com`, the OG image said "Taco Week," HTML titles and favicons all showed tacos, the README badge pointed to the new domain. Swapped back to burgers, ran again, clean round-trip.

The map is live at [sbburgerweekmap.com](https://sbburgerweekmap.com) and the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/samgutentag/sbburgerweek). Fork it, edit `config.js`, run `python3 apply-theme.py`, and map your own food week.
