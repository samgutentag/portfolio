## React Projects — Learning in Public

This series documents my journey through the [FreeCodeCamp "Master React by Building 25 Projects"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-react-by-building-25-projects/) course.

I'm using this as an honest learning log to level up as a software developer.

## About

Each project has its own folder and is paired with a blog post published here at [gutentag.world](https://www.gutentag.world/master-react).

The posts follow a consistent format inspired by the “Five Whys” framework and focus on what I struggled with, what I learned, and what still doesn’t make sense.
