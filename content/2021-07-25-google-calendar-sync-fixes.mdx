## Calendars Demand Consistency

In some instances, not all of your calendars will sync from Google Calendars to all of your devices.
I have noticed this in particular with a _subscribed_ calendar.

On the opposite, Google Calendar loves to sync one of its own custom `Contacts` calendar... you can
turn that off too.

## Sneaky Google Calendar Sync Settings Page

Navigate to this [Google Calendar Sync Selection][sync-selection] page where you can toggle each
calendar on and off.
